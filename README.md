# matlab-implementation-of-ml-algorithms
Implementation of machine learning algorithms in mat lab. The aim of these programs is to understand the detailed working of the ML algorithms instead of relying on black-box implementations of the same. Many of these programs were used for completing projects and homeworks for UF course EEL 5840.
